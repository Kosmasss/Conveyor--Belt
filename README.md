This project is a two motor conveyor belt where the most of the parts are 3D printed more specificly the base, the belt and the belt connections.
The belt can increase indefenetly by printing more belt parts and connections for it.Two 12V motors a DC motor controller (L298N) and a potentimeter are wired to the arduino 
that controls the speed and synchronizes the two motors.The base is adjutable so it can fit the belt no mater  the size of it.
